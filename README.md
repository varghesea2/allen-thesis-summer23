## Background
The Aim of this thesis is to create a Dynamic Malware detection model,
which is a updated version of the already working Static Malware Detection Model
(Webguard browser add-on). A machine learning model will be deployed to achieve the desired results. 

## Approach/Plan
Collect data/information from the browser by using functions calls. This collected information will then be passed to machine learning model which in turn will be able to help in applying/enforcing policies, preventing/avoiding malicious website, links etc.

## Outcomes/results
Using the above mentioned approch we should be able to monitor functions and their properties that are being used through out the website and collect information from them, this in turn helps to train the machine learning model that is being implemented.

## Concepts/Topics learned
So far i was able to understand  the key difference between properties of the object being used/created as well as creating new instance of a given function so that it can be monitored and policies/other function calls can be embedded in them. This concept of intercepting the function call and applying/enforcing policies or other function calls helps to give users more control of their data as well as blocking unwanted re-direction which prevents drive by downloads and other unwanted installations.
